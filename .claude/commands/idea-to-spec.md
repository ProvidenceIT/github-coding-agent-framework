# Idea to App Specification Workflow

Transform your idea into a production-ready `app_spec.txt` file through structured planning, research, and refinement.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. IDEA CAPTURE
I'll help you articulate your core idea clearly.

**Questions I'll ask:**
- What problem does this solve?
- Who is the target user?
- What's the core value proposition?
- Any specific inspirations or examples?

### 2. FEATURE PLANNING
We'll break down your idea into concrete features.

**I'll help you define:**
- Core features (MVP essentials)
- Secondary features (nice-to-haves)
- User workflows and journeys
- Technical requirements

### 3. RESEARCH & VALIDATION
I'll research best practices and similar solutions.

**Research areas:**
- Technology stack recommendations
- UI/UX patterns for your use case
- Security considerations
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility standards

### 4. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
We'll design the technical foundation.

**Architecture decisions:**
- Frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- Backend technology (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Database choice
- Authentication approach
- Deployment strategy

### 5. SPECIFICATION GENERATION
I'll create a comprehensive `app_spec.txt` file.

**Includes:**
- Project overview
- Feature breakdown (50+ detailed features)
- Technology stack
- UI/UX requirements
- Testing requirements
- Deployment plan

### 6. REVIEW & REFINEMENT
You'll review and we'll refine together.

**Final checks:**
- Feature completeness
- Technical feasibility
- Scope appropriateness
- Clear acceptance criteria

## Let's Start!

Tell me about your idea. What application do you want to build?

You can provide:
- A brief description
- A problem you're trying to solve
- An example of a similar app
- Or just a general concept

I'll guide you through the rest of the process step by step.
